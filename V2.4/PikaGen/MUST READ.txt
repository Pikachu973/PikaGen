MUST READ AND FOLLOW ALL STEPS, OR IT WILL NOT WORK!!


Step 1. You must open pikagen.py and find the line that contains `folder_path = "/Users/bai/Desktop/PikaGen" #CHANGE THIS TO YOUR OWN DIRECTORY!` and you will need to change that folder directory to your folder directory!
Step 2. You must install requirements.txt in a terminal or command prompt window.
Step 3. Put Valid/Working HTTP/HTTPS Proxies in `proxy.txt`! Must use format (IP:Port) and new line for each individual proxy.
(skip step 3 if u dont use checker!)
Step 4. Run the python script pikagen.py!

NOTE: 
1. DO NOT PUT DEAD/INVALID PROXIES INTO proxy.txt!
2. YOU CAN PUT PikaGen FOLDER ANYWHERE, JUST MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE DIRECTORY (CHECK STEP 1), AND DO NOT DELETE / MOVE ANYTHING OUT OF THIS FOLDER OR IT WILL NOT WORK!
3. CHECKER WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT PUT VALID HTTP/HTTPS PROXIES IN THE proxy.txt FILE!
4. IF YOU DID NOT USE THE CHECKER, THE UNCHECKED DISCORD NITRO CODES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PUT IN unchecked.txt FILE!
5. ALL HITS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PUT IN hit.txt FILE!
